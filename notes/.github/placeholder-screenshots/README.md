This folder is intended to store screenshots required for the assignment.

Please add the following images when you capture them:

- `branch-protection.png` — Screenshot of the branch protection configuration for `main`.
- `pr-checks-passing.png` — Screenshot of a PR showing all checks passing and approvals.

Tips:
- GitHub Settings → Branches → Add protection rule for `main` → Take a screenshot.
- Create a sample PR, run CI, wait for checks to complete, then take a screenshot and add it here.

After you add the images, commit and push them to your assignment branch so they appear in the PR.
